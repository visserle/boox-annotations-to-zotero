One of the most careful and trustworthy of modern naturalists, Mr. Charles Darwin, has told us that many kinds of monkeys have a strong taste for tea, coffee, and spirituous liquors, and that he has seen them smoke tobacco.⁠[3] Moreover, writing on the authority of Brehm,⁠[4] he says that the natives of North-Eastern Africa catch the wild baboons by exposing vessels with strong beer, by which they are made drunk.

The same historian also tells us that Cyrus gave a feast to the Persians in which he provided rich wines;⁠[86]and the following story is narrated concerning that monarch, showing the excess to which drinking was carried in his day.⁠[87] Cyrus made war upon Tomyris, queen of the Massagetæ, a race living in Central Asia, and by the advice of Cræsus the Lydian, he made a feint of deserting his camp, and left “flowing goblets of wine” to tempt the enemy to excess. The stratagem succeeded, and when the enemy was drunk, he attacked him and took the queen’s son prisoner. Cyrus was, however, ultimately defeated and slain.
The drink here referred to was made from the vine, but Herodotus also mentions an incident which shows that palm-wine was drunk in the time of Cambyses (B.C. 529-522). “He (Cambyses) sent the Ichthyophagæ into Ethiopia with the following gifts, to wit, a purple robe, a gold chain for the neck, armlets, an alabaster box of myrrh, and a cask of palm-wine.”

Yes; but it is also “said” that somewhere in an English churchyard there is the following characteristic epitaph:—
“Beneath this stone, in hopes of Zion,
Doth rest the landlord of the Lion:
Resigned unto the heavenly will,
His son keeps on the business still.”
